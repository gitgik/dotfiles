# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use Shift-TAB for reverse direction

# i.e. cd ~/dow<Tab> => cd ~/Downloads/
set completion-ignore-case on

# when `completion-ignore-case` is enabled (default off)
set completion-map-case on

# Immediately show all possible completions (default off)
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Show the common prefix of the list of possible completions first, and then
# cycle through it when hitting TAB for menu completion
# (default off)

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
# (default off)

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
