# If set to `on`, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, Readline treats

# TODO: Add a short description
# This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion
# similar to show-all-if-ambiguous. If set to `on`, words which have more than
# one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the possible
# completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed
# immediately instead of ringing the bell. The default value is `off`.
